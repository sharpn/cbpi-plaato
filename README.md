This is a sensor plugin so when you go to add a new sensor there will be a new sensor type called PlaatoSensor

There a 3 options to set for this sensor

1. Api Key
   - This is the key you can get by emailing support@plaato.io, you will get one api key per plaato (so this makes it more of an id)
2. Pin
   - This is the metric that you would like to show for the sensor, there are multiple options and they can be found by visiting [Plaato](https://www.plaato.io/api "Plaato")
3. Refresh Time
   - This is the interval in which the sensor will call for data from the plaato servers
